Migration is one of the most hotly debated policy issues and has grown in importance on the global agenda of the United Nations (UN). But how much do we really know about migration and the impact of migration policies and programs? Do we have the data to make a strong case for the inclusion of migration in the post-2015 development agenda? This article takes a hard look at the migration evidence base and outlines a set of recommendations to achieve a â€œmigration data revolutionâ€ over the next decade. The article is written from a global perspective, and discusses data on both regular and irregular migration. It also considers how data are shared and used by policymakers, and why there is so little data on the impact of migration programs.",ESSAY,5192015,Frank Laczko,,,,,Produced for Digital,Global Commons,,,

In recent years, no issue in regional migration (involving the United States, Mexico, and Central America) has attracted this level of red-hot attention and controversy. This article will first examine the numbersâ€”and the trendsâ€”of the migration of unaccompanied children prior to and in the wake of this summerâ€™s crisis. It will explore the complex set of push and pull factors responsible for the surge, including security concerns in Central America, structural economic dynamics in the region, the desire for family reunification, U.S. immigration policies that mandate special treatment of child migrants, and the role of smuggling networks. It will survey the policy responses of the governments of the United States, Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to the surgeâ€”and their impacts. Further, it will examine the ramifications of the child migration influx at the federal, state, and local levels in the United States, as well as the effects of the crisis on the broader political immigration debate in the United States. Lastly, the article will offer recommendations on how to better respond to child migrationâ€”both in the short term and on an ongoing, long-term basis.",ESSAY,5062015,Faye Hipsman,Muzaffar Chishti,,,,Produced for Digital,Americas,Central America,North America,

The lessons drawn from resettlements and planned relocations thus farâ€”most notably in the Carteret Islands of Papua New Guineaâ€”underscore the importance of adequate funding, careful planning, restoring traditional livelihoods, and ensuring voluntary community participation throughout the entire process. Critical hurdles persist, however, particularly for the most vulnerable communities within nation-states. This article explores the importance of adequate funding and identifies the dangerous and nagging impediments present, even as climate-induced migration advances in the adaptation discourse. With a focus on the Carteret Islandersâ€™ ongoing relocation and resettlement to the island of Bougainville, this article argues that communities may face economic development and political gaps. Economic development gaps inhibit communitiesâ€™ abilities to address redevelopment needs that elude appropriate classification for funding because they are neither strictly â€œclimateâ€ nor â€œdevelopmentâ€ categories. Additionally, political gaps exacerbate the challenges of accessing existing funding for local communities that are at odds with the national governments that purportedly represent their interests. These gaps compound the general lack of adequate funding for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Considering models for a new framework, this article explores the applicability of existing community-oriented funding regimes to address the political and economic development challenges that climate migrants face.",ESSAY,5052015,Maxine Burkett,,,,,Produced for Digital,Asia,Oceania,,

This means people are moving in ways that are not always captured in accepted international migration statistics and to countries that are ill-equipped to develop or implement a national immigration policy. The confluence of these factors has contributed to a globalization of â€˜undocumentedness,â€™ and yet, the global conversation about undocumentedness still orients itself to the United States and Europe. A quick survey of extant literature on undocumentedness, international migration, and informal labor points to a significant gap in scholarship on the causes and consequences of permanent and growing cross-border undocumented migration between developing countries, and as a global phenomenon. Research on undocumented immigrant communities in the West frequently focuses on social justice or national security concerns in a single place with a large undocumented population, rather than placing the emergence of those communities within the broader context of how international migration has changed. For example, undocumented migrants in the West are likely to have been undocumented migrants in developing or middle-income countries as well. Migrant networks often span many countries at once. This article will position undocumentedness as a global phenomenon, examining how economic globalization has contributed to a globalization of low- to middle-income migration to regional powers with limited-to-no migration management strategy or infrastructure. It will also consider some of the challenges undocumented migration poses in countries dealing with endemic poverty, massive internal migration, and structural race/caste/tribal fissures. Finally, it will consider what citizenship and belonging mean in this new global era.",ESSAY,5042015,Kavitha Rajagopalan,,,,,Produced for Digital,Global Commons,,,

The Development of a New Post-National Form of Membership in the Region,https://jia.site.drupaldisttest.cc.columbia.edu/news/toward-south-american-citizenship-development-new-post-national-form-membership-region-0,"Migration law may be discussed as an example of a clash between two central contradictory globalization processes: first, the transformation of political membership through new forms of quasi-citizenship and their impact for traditional understandings of identity and belonging in the national polity, and second, the securitization of migration and the attempt by the state to control its borders, considered as its â€œlast bastion of sovereignty.â€ The outcome of this dispute results in conflicting mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion and in illiberal state practices, contrary to fundamental rights, with profound implications for the rule of law in Europe and elsewhere. South America has usually been neglected in academic debates on migration law. This is regretful for two main reasons: first, the development of new liberal ideas on migration in the region which challenge established assumptions on the regulation of migration in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere, and second, the parallel establishment of a South American citizenship. This article will look at this aspect, in particular the Mercosur Residence Agreement, which establishes a free movement of people regime in South America.

Over the next five decades, Africans, Arabs, and Asians will migrate in unprecedented numbers to cities, especially to their slums. Many of these urban settlements are insecure, disorganized, and violent. These are fragile cities and such migrations can threaten their inhabitants, countries, and the wider neighborhood. The analytical focus on fragile cities offers a novel scale when compared to fragile and failing states. It is also one that is preoccupying national policymakers, military strategists, and development experts. Drawing on theoretical and empirical contributions from geography, criminology, and sociology, this article identifies four mega-risks shaping urban fragilityâ€”the transformation and concentration of violence, turbo-urbanization, youth bulges, and the relentless penetration of new technologies. It also considers successful approaches to reversing city fragility, including twinning fragile cities with healthier and wealthier ones, investing in hotspot policing, interventions addressing at-risk youth, support for inclusive and cohesive urban growth, and the targeted application of new technologies.",ESSAY,5042015,Robert Muggah,,,,,Produced for Digital,Global Commons,,,

It is likely that the number of international students worldwide may have reached 5.2 million in 2014, with these students responsible for expenditures for tuition, accommodation, and other living expenses of no less than $50 billion. Since 1970, the number of international students is estimated to have doubled every fifteen years, on average, and the pace may be accelerating because of the expanding pool of tertiary education graduates in emerging economies where more education suppliers are entering the market. Experts predict that there will be at least 8 million international students by market. 2025, a larger group than the total population of Switzerland, Norway, or Ireland. This article traces the growth of student migration to the Cold War period when it was driven largely by the competition between the Soviet bloc and the West for influence in the developing world, how it has since been transformed (and now is being driven mainly by competition for dominance in technological innovation and trade), and concludes with questions on what it means for the less-developed countries of origin.",ESSAY,5042015,Manolo Abella,,,,,Produced for Digital,Global Commons,,,

This provokes their overseers in the United Nations (UN) and other relief agencies to conduct frequent social engineering to enhance the campsâ€™ legibility. Hence, we see orderly, perpendicular rows, standardized units from redistricting to the allocation of diapers, and so forthâ€”all of the follies of high modernism that James Scott predicted in ""Seeing Like a State,"" but writ small. Indeed, my qualitative research from the Zaâ€™atari refugee camp, located in Jordan along the Syrian border, indicates that refugees, especially middle-class ones like Syriaâ€™s, rebel against uniformityâ€”or what Scott describes as â€œmetisâ€â€”and seek to recreate their domiciles as best they can from the meager canvas tents and campers allotted to them. Put simply, they see their surroundings more as the disorderly â€œsidewalk balletâ€ of Jane Jacobsâ€™ Greenwich Village than the high modernist yet sterile functionalism of Robert Moses. This holds important policy implications for the future of how we devise refugee camps, which increasingly resemble small cities; how we settle internally displaced persons (IDPs); and how we deal with the aftermath of mass population displacements. From direct cash transfers to the districting of refugees, some bureaucratic flexibility is required but so is an acknowledgement and embrace of refugeesâ€™ do-it-yourself ethos that is rooted in their resistance to authority and trauma from violence. Drawing from the literature in social anthropology and political science, this article presents new evidence from Zaâ€™atari that disputes the utility of a high modernist approach to the social engineering of large displaced populations.",ESSAY,5042015,Lionel Beehner,,,,,Produced for Digital,Middle East,,,

Legal access to preferred destinations is now an option only for the privileged few. The rest are forced into the arms of those able to help them circumvent ever-increasing controls and deterrents. Migrant smuggling, the business of moving people across borders for profit, is a sordid and dangerous enterprise, often placing lives and well-being at serious risk. And the dangers do not end there. Many of the worldâ€™s migrants find themselves deeply in debt to recruitment agencies, brokers, and sometimes their own employers before they even start work. In too many cases, these asymmetrical arrangements reach the level of human trafficking: Victims are tricked or coerced into situations of exploitation from which they cannot escape. This article argues that such practices, while unacceptable, are also inevitable. Without profound reforms to global migration regimesâ€”and indeed to the organization of the global economyâ€”there is likely no effective solution to migration-related exploitation. But important steps can be taken, even within the limits of current political constraints, to minimize vulnerability and harm. These include promoting political and legal acceptance of basic rights for all migrants, developing quality control systems for international labor recruitment, eliminating recruitment fees and sponsorship schemes, and co-opting civil society in an effort to increase transparency and accountability of governments and business activities.",ESSAY,5042015,Anne T.

Over the past year, a number of experts have invoked the possibility of genocide against this group, citing a dangerous combination of ethnic and religious tensions, discriminatory deprivation of basic rights, restricted access to food and medicine, hate speech, and large numbers fleeing the country. Yet up to now, domestic and international responses to the Rohingya crisis have been weak, with serious consequences for this community, the prospects of democratic transition and rule of law in Myanmar, and the integrity of international law. This article highlights the basis for why the possibility of genocide has been raised and argues that the international community has legal obligations to act. These considerations could contribute to sharpening focus on the urgent need for regionally coordinated solutions, based on enforceable principles of nondiscrimination and inclusion, specifically guarantees of citizenship rights and protection.

These unaccompanied children (UAC) were charged with violating U.S. immigration laws and were placed in deportation proceedings. They enter a system that involves numerous government agencies which they must navigate. Most are released by ORR if they have family or another sponsor in the United States able to care for them, though they must continue to fight their deportation in immigration court, often without an attorney. Many UAC have legitimate claims that would lead to legal status if they could navigate the countryâ€™s complex web of immigration lawsâ€”approximately 40 percent of UAC are potentially eligible for some kind of relief from deportation. This article discusses the immigration system that UAC encounter, challenges they face within this system and proposals for reform. First, it provides a general overview of the U.S. immigration legal and detention system that UAC come into contact with when they arrive at the border. Then it discusses legal remedies available to this population and explains the difficulties of obtaining legal status as well as other challenges children face after release from ORR custody. The article then surveys the growing consensus about and efforts for reformâ€”such as appointing government-funded counsel for children, broader proposals to create a more â€œchild-friendlyâ€ immigration system, and the need for more comprehensive immigration reform. The article also explores threats to the current system that extends due process protections to these vulnerable immigrants.",ESSAY,5042015,Annie Chen,Jennifer Gill,,,,Produced for Digital,Americas,North America,,

As the conflict dragged on, paramilitary groups organized to combat some of the left-wing groups that were grabbing land and terrorizing the countryside with violent tactics. This has made the conflict more complex and difficult to resolve, despite the fact that one main paramilitary group, the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), was largely demobilized by 2006. Today, the effects of the conflict have taken a toll on the countryâ€™s society. For instance, Colombia has the second-largest number of internally displaced persons, after Syria, because of its ongoing internal struggles. Peace talks have taken place on and off unsuccessfully over the years, but in 2012 FARC representatives and President Juan Manuel Santos returned to the negotiating table, this time in Havana, Cuba. The prospect of a revised political solution attracted both actors to the negotiating table.

Over time, political stalemate, impunity, and the closure of most avenues for peaceful dissent caused many individuals to become disenchanted with the results of these nonviolent tactics, turning instead towards more violent means of protest. Inside Bahrain, opposition groups used the peopleâ€™s dedication to nonviolence to better position themselves. In addition, international responses to violent strategies elsewhere in the region have led to foreign military intervention, greater political attention in international forums, and more consistent coverage in mainstream media outlets. The use of peaceful dissent also suffers from a lack of international legal protection and regulation. The lack of regulation left those suffering from grave human rights violations as a result of peaceful dissent with few avenues that could provide more protection and accountability. Through the lens of the Bahraini protests, this article analyzes how the strategy of using nonviolence to create social and political change has been undermined and almost obliterated due to the lack of international legal structures to protect peaceful protesters from their governments, as well as the double standards apparent in the response of the international community.",ESSAY,12112014,Maryam Al-Khawaja,,,,,Produced for Digital,Middle East,,,

But even with the worst kind of authoritarianism, political legitimacy remains fundamental for the longevity of the regime. To prolong its political life, the military has embarked on distributing economic benefits to the people in an effort to acquire acceptance and loyalty through various populist programs, a practice made famous by its political nemesis, the Shinawatra political clan. For example, the military has ordered the disbursement of funds owed to poor farmers by the previously deposed government under a rice subsidy program. For the military, its survival depends on popular appeal. To keep the people happy, the military must demonstrate its ability to deliver economic benefits; and this partly hinges on how much the West perceives the suspension of democratic freedoms as a threat. Thailand is vulnerable to sanctions as it is linked to global supply chains of crucial commodities. The disruption of these links would impact the local economy and thus local consumers. Here, international sanctions have the potential to influence the behavior of the Thai junta. The United States and the European Union have warned that they may take more aggressive measures, including boycotting Thai products, if the military fails to restore democracy soon.

South Sudanâ€™s experience shows that the appropriateness of constitutional provisions to a local context remains key, and that the time-tested elements of good governance still matter: devolution and separation of powers, appropriate government and electoral systems, and strong institutions. In nations as ethnically diverse as South Sudan, decentralization is necessary for effective public participation, and it also contributes to bringing government closer to the people and empowering local governments to be more responsive to their constituenciesâ€™ needs. Ineffectual decentralization, on the other hand, leads to marginalization of some groups, and causes allegiances to form along ethnic rather than national lines. Should fighting break out in such a context, the conflict frequently takes on an ethnic nature, as it has in South Sudan. While failures in decentralization and other governance arrangements may have provoked civil war in South Sudan, addressing such weaknesses through constitutional amendments and capacity building, for example, may put the country back on track towards achieving and maintaining peace and stability.

After having sustained generous welfare entitlements for several decades, this development model is coming under increasing strains in the face of a growing and increasingly educated youth population, falling public spending, and an inflexible economic structure. Underpinning this failure is a weak and dependent private sector that survives largely through privileges rather than competition. This failure is most evident in the regionâ€™s labor-abundant economies, where privileges are concentrated amongst connected firms but employment is concentrated amongst small, informal sector firms operating at the margins of the economy. I argue that there is a deep trade-off between employment and autonomy; sustainable employment generation is not possible without giving greater autonomy to the private sector and releasing competitive space for its operation. However, private sector development is not simply a question of technocratic policy reform. In a context where economic controls generate rents for insiders and are used to sustain elite coalitions, development has to be conceived as part of a broader political concession.",ESSAY,12112014,Adeel Malik,,,,,Produced for Digital,Middle East,,,

How has that enthusiasm come to be shared by the right and left, by Tea Party members alongside Occupy activists? Without diminishing the importance of economic crises and policymakersâ€™ responses to those crises in shaping the movements of the last five years, I call attention to developments both outside and within movements that have made ours into a participatory age. Among those developments, the rise of the Internet has not only made protests easier to organize, it has also produced new understandings of equality, organization, and democracy.

In this article, I put the spotlight on North Africaâ€”Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisiaâ€”which saw different protest dynamics and political outcomes subsequently. Drawing from mainstream literature on determinants of democratization and feminist literature on women and democratic transitions, I examine how womenâ€™s preexisting legal status and social positions, as well as the broad structural, institutional, and cultural contexts, shaped the course and immediate outcomes of the Arab Spring in the countries examined. I argue that those countries that saw advances in womenâ€™s participation and rights prior to the Arab Spring are the ones most likely to transition successfully to democracy, and indeed, to establish a more women-friendly democracy; and that womenâ€™s growing political leadership will influence the quality of ongoing democratizations in the Maghreb countries of Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia.",ESSAY,12112014,Valentine M.

To do so, we begin with unpacking the battle that took place in Dubai in December 2012 at the World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT-12) between competing state powers, technology policy regimes, and civil society activists jockeying on the global stage to promote Internet freedom. Particular emphasis is placed on the discourses and controversies carried over from the Arab Spring surrounding Internet freedom as democracy promotion, including the growing importance of transnationally-organized and tech-savvy civil society activists who have joined these opaque policy debates. The next section focuses on highlighting the new practices and ideologies of this particularly novel â€œcommunity of practiceâ€ comprising transnational tech-savvy activists who have joined the Internet freedom proto-regime. The final discussion elucidates the policy innovations and frameworks born from the interactions of this diverse stakeholder network since the Arab Spring, and contrasts them with those of the state and private sector stakeholders who traditionally hold sway in shaping information infrastructure policies. We conclude by outlining the opportunities and challenges facing these policy entrepreneurs and the democratic interests of global Internet users.",ESSAY,12112014,Muzammil M.

Much of this debate has centered on their use by governments, often for the purpose of surveillance and warfare. This focus on the stateâ€™s use obscures the opportunity for civil society actors, including social movements, to make use of these technologies. This article briefly reviews the technological innovation before proceeding to a typology of civil society uses, ranging from art to digital disruption. This typology emphasizes the dual-use nature of this technology and, in the process, highlights the need for a best-practices framework to guide such use. Drone usage for the public good, it is argued, should prioritize 1) subsidiarity; 2) physical and material security; 3) the â€œdo no harmâ€ principle; 4) the public good; and respect for 5) privacy, and 6) data.

These farmersâ€™ objectives and circumstances are diverse, varying with both their biophysical environments and their socioeconomic and cultural contexts. Agroecological intensification (AEI), or the integration of agroecological principles into farm and system management, can improve the performance of agricultureâ€”â€œperformanceâ€ being locally defined and potentially including productivity, nutrition, resilience, and sustainability. In principle, AEI is relevant for all forms of agriculture, whether it is pursued as a business, as a means to support family nutrition, or for both income and self-provisioning. Conventional approaches to research and extension are, however, poorly designed to support AEI across diverse socio-ecological contexts, particularly given the weakness of research and extension systems in food-insecure parts of the world. Because agroecological principles must be implemented in a context-dependent manner and AEI is a knowledge-intensive process, delivering the benefits of AEI requires a radical reconsideration of the ways in which agricultural knowledge is produced and shared. Emerging developments in participatory methods, as well as in information and communications technologies (ICT), can contribute to innovative strategies that allow systematic matching of optionsâ€”diversification strategies, crops or varieties, agronomic practices, and market arrangementsâ€”across heterogeneous contexts.",ESSAY,9282014,Rebecca Nelson,Richard Coe,,,,Produced for Digital,Global Commons,,,

In Zambia and Ghana, the total farmland controlled by holdings between 5 and 100 hectares now exceeds the amount of land held by smallholder farms under 5 hectares. Farmland holdings in all three countries have become substantially more concentrated since the mid-1900s. The rapid rise in the number of farms in the 5 to 100 hectare category represents a relatively hidden but revolutionary change in farm structure, reflecting increased investment in land by relatively wealthy urban-based individuals. Only in Ghana has the rise of medium-scale farms been significantly associated with successful graduation of small-scale farmers into medium-scale stature. Continued rapid alienation of land to medium- and large-scale investors is likely to exacerbate localized land scarcity, restrict the potential of smallholder-led development, and put unrealistic pressure on the non-farm economy to absorb Africaâ€™s rapidly rising labor force.",ESSAY,9282014,Antony Chapoto,Chewe Nkonde,Jordan Chamberlin,Milu Muyanga,"Nicholas Sitko, Thomas S.

The policies currently in place are only partially effective in terms of changing diet and enhancing food security, particularly for low-income consumers.

There has been some acknowledgement of the role of global economic forces in the food crisis by global policymakers, but global food security initiatives still largely emphasize increased food production over other measures.

This has instigated some important gains for development, contributing to economic growth, poverty reduction, and better trajectories for the next generation.

Two decades later, the threats remain much the same, yet the hemispheric security agenda has fragmented, replaced in part by projects designed to build specifically South American regional institutions. As some scholars predicted, heterogeneous threat perceptions across the region, differences over democratization, and tensions over the effects of free trade and market liberalization have confounded the effort to build a hemispheric security agenda. Yet the efforts by former President Hugo ChÃ¡vez of Venezuela to radically transform the regional security order by building a Bolivarian alliance of states as an explicit counterweight to U.S. power have also fallen short. Instead, Brazilâ€™s ascent as a global economic power and the growing prosperity of the region as a whole has created an opportunity for Brazil to organize new mid-range political institutions, embodied in the Union of South American States (UNASUR), that exclude the United States yet pursue a consensual security agenda. This emerging regional order is designed by Brazil to secure its leadership in South America and allow it to choose when and where to involve the United States in managing regional crises.

Latin American countries have been moving toward the concepts of multidimensional security and security of the individual and society, and away from the classical understanding of the security dilemma posed by an external threat to the state. Illegal narcotics, the proliferation of guns, and other transnational threats, combined with undergoverned space and the weak state syndrome, generated an extraordinary crime wave, which gives the region the highest murder rate in the world. Moreover, crime imposes a heavy cost on economic growth and democratic governance. This insecurity crosses international borders, and the institutions of public securityâ€”police, military, and judicial systemsâ€”are hard pressed to meet the challenge. The privatization of security is a symptom of the problem and a potential source of abuse. The United States shares responsibility for the violence due to U.S. demand for illegal drugs and the fact that it is a supplier of arms to Latin America. At the same time, there is a growing consensus in support of common action, as evidenced by the international coalition that is operating under Operation Martilloâ€”the antinarcotics effort in the Caribbean and Central America.

Accordingly, this is an appropriate moment to evaluate the results obtained. The following essay considers how the international prohibition regime created the crime of drug trafficking. The ensuing function of denied demand is the inescapable basis for the development of organized crime. Second, costs of the regime are critically assessed. The former include institutional costs of law enforcement and of the incarceration of individuals sentenced for drug trafficking and related offences, e.g., violence and financial crimes. The indirect costs are difficult to gauge and impossible to monetize. They include the immense suffering caused by drug trafficking as well as the deterioration of public services due to corruption. The present situation on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border is sufficiently eloquent evidence. Also, narcotics legislation leads to racial tension since the incarceration rates for non-whites for these offences is considerably higher than for whites in the United State and the United Kingdom. Third, political premises are briefly analyzed, namely the implementation of narcotics liaison offices in foreign jurisdictions and the linking of foreign aid and trade privileges to a certification of trade partnersâ€™ adherence to U.S. antinarcotic drugs law enforcement. One might claim, somewhat counterintuitively, that decriminalization of drug trafficking is not necessary. Drug trafficking has already been decriminalized de facto, if not de jure, by the sheer, constant saturation of the market place.",ESSAY,11212012,Frank G.

It is one of the fastest growing areas of cross-border criminal enterprise involving high profits and low risk for those involved in timber trafficking, wildlife smuggling, the black market in ozone-depleting substances, and the illegal trade in hazardous and toxic waste. TEC is increasingly characterized by commodity-specific smuggling networks, the intrusion of criminal groups involved in other forms of illegal trade and, in some cases, politically motivated organizations for whom this generates income to support other activities. But unlike other forms of transnational crime, there is no international treaty to prevent, suppress, and punish the kinds of trafficking and smuggling that constitute transnational environmental crime. The global regulatory and enforcement community has therefore developed innovative collaborative mechanisms to meet both the criminal and environmental challenges associated with this increasingly serious form of cross-border crime. Despite their successes, their efforts remain under-resourced. This article examines the challenges of TEC and efforts to respond to those challenges in the face of uncertain resources and limited awareness.",ESSAY,11212012,Lorraine Elliott,,,,,Produced for Digital,Global Commons,,,

Since that time, there has been cause for hope and despair. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and an array of international donors have made great strides in acknowledging the growing problem of drug trafficking and have implemented practical measures to stem this flow. All the while, the fears of many observers have been confirmed as the insidious effects of the drug trade have begun to take effect in many West African states. Consumption is on the rise and narco-corruption now undermines the rule of law and legitimate economic growth necessary for development and stability. One of the most alarming trends that place Africa and Africans on the radar of policy makers, law enforcement, and researchers alike is the number of new fronts on which the illicit drug trade is growing. Its geographic expansion beyond the relatively confined region of West Africa is now endangering East and Southern Africa. The arrival of new drugs to the regionâ€”heroin and Amphetamine-Type Stimulants (ATS, commonly referred to as synthetic drugs)â€”has been accompanied by the discovery of local manufacturing facilities to process them. Lastly, the growing level of involvement by Africansâ€”who initially served as facilitators but now appear to be taking a more proactive roleâ€”raises concerns that a new generation of African DTOs is rising in the ranks. This paper examines how each of these trends are contributing to the twenty-first century expansion of the drug trade in Africa and summarizes some of the impacts they are having on the states and their populations.",ESSAY,11212012,Ashely Neese Bybee,,,,,Produced for Digital,Africa,West Africa,,

Instead they are overlapping in nature in terms of the crimes committed, the offenders involved, and in how criminal opportunities are exploited for profit. This article analyzes the similarities and differences between organized crime and transnational crime, concluding that they are in fact manifestations of the same underlying conduct and the same pool of criminal offenders.

A marriage of the philosophies of Jane Jacobs and Robert Moses is required, recognizing important cultural centers and economies, while allowing new buildings, infrastructures and ecologies to be incorporated in harmonious coexistence.

Critical in this examination is recovering some of the differences between being powerless and being invisible or impotent. Under certain conditions the powerless make history without getting empowered in the process. There are two types of acute challenges facing cities that pertain to this question. One is asymmetric war and the urbanizing of war that it entails. My research finds that cities are a type of weak regime that can obstruct but not destroy superior military force; this weak regime rests on the civic character of cities. The second type of challenge concerns anti-immigrant hatred and violence. In an exploration of the hard work of making open cities, particular histories show us that it is possible to reposition the immigrant and the citizen as, above all, similar urban subjects, rather than essentially different. Cities are one of the key sites where new norms and identities are made.

Bueno de Mesquita and Smith discovered that Rizzo behaved as all politicians do, whether democrats or dictators, securing his hold on power by reducing the size of his electorate. Rizzo manipulated the timing of elections to ensure low voter turnout and held special elections on policies that would give the city council greater control of the budget.

Using a stylized game-theoretic model, this article analyzes the decision-making process of a dictator and explains the different outcomes. A rational dictator only leaves the country if the expected costs from punishment outweigh the benefits of staying. For the international coalition, the model identifies a trade-off between the cost of the intervention and the potential for economic benefit from a successful intervention. A higher number of participants in the coalition increases the probability of the interventionâ€™s success. However, if the intervention fails, coalition participants lose all economic benefits. Therefore, an intervening country benefits from the participation of other countries because it lowers the risk of failure. If the intervention succeeds, the economic benefits are shared among all intervening countries. Thus, an intervening country has the most to gain if it acts alone. Furthermore, a country can deliberately abstain from an intervention to benefit from higher shares of economic profit if the intervention fails and coalition members lose all economic benefits. The model can help explain the rarity of unanimous votes for an intervention and the complex and tedious bargaining process surrounding decisions to intervene.",ESSAY,12012011,Utz J.

This article examines the effectiveness of this system of control with respect to visual art. I find that contemporary art in particular is able to communicateâ€”and express frustrations withâ€”the tensions between rapid economic development and political stagnation, and between cultural traditionalism and modernization. Art can speak with relative impunity because its meaning is more difficult to pinpoint than written criticism of the regime. However, it is important to note that few, if any, Vietnamese artists advocate a change of regime. Instead, they emphasize their concerns about tensions in society caused by rapid development and its effect on centuries-old traditions. The current one-party regime certainly contributes to this tension, but it would be an oversimplification to call these artists â€œprotest artistsâ€; rather, they act as a lens through which both Vietnamese citizens and outsiders get an honest and unbiased view of a country that is too often thought of in terms of colonialism or war.",ESSAY,12012011,Samantha Libby,,,,,Produced for Digital,Asia,South East Asia,,

Kim enjoys mass support due to his perceived success in strengthening the race and humiliating its enemies. Thanks in part to decades of skillful propaganda, North Koreans generally equate the race with their state, so that ethno-nationalism and state-loyalty are mutually enforcing. In this respect North Korea enjoys an important advantage over its rival, for in the Republic of Korea ethno-nationalism militates against support for a state that is perceived as having betrayed the race. South Koreansâ€™ â€œgood race, bad stateâ€ attitude is reflected in widespread sympathy for the people of the North and in ambivalent feelings toward the United States and Japan, which are regarded as friends of the republic but enemies of the race.

This article argues that the governance, accountability and transparency arrangements of sovereign wealth funds reflect the quality of political institutions within the countries that own them.

Several variables reinforce the durability of this regimeâ€”chief among them the mass out-migration and the large inflow of remittances that has decimated the middle class and dampened the political voice of those who remain in the country. Beginning in 2000, Zimbabweâ€™s authoritarianism became militarized with the overt intrusion of the security sector into the political arena, a process that reached its peak before the June 2008 presidential runoff election. The electoral dimension of its authoritarianism stems from the fact that the regime unfailingly holds elections in search of popular legitimacy but then manipulates them for its own ends. This article dissects Zimbabweâ€™s militarized form of electoral authoritarianism with specific reference to the 2008 reign of terror.

This article argues that state power is the most powerful weapon in the authoritarian arsenal. After clarifying the regime-state distinction and explaining why regime durability involves more than just duration, we discuss four â€œinfrastructural mechanismsâ€ through which authoritarian regimes stabilize and sustain their rule: (1) coercing rivals, (2) extracting revenues, (3) registering citizens and (4) cultivating dependence. Since state apparatuses are the institutions best geared for performing these tasks, their effectiveness underpins authoritarian durability in a way that no other institution can duplicate.

Indeed, regimes with these institutions have longer tenures than those without them. Using evidence from postwar dictatorships, this study demonstrates that parties and legislatures also enhance the ability of authoritarian regimes to withstand leadership transitions. Transfers of power are inherently destabilizing.

This paper argues that their continued rapid economic growth and resultant ever-expanding engagement with the external world is not completely innocent, and that their growth has begun to influence their bilateral relations. Prima facie, multilateral forums provide China and India with a relatively neutral playground in which the two countries have gradually begun to decipher their stronger commonality of interests in addressing their regional/global challenges within multilateral settings. This expanding mutual trust and understanding at the multilateral level is expected to have a positive impact on the nature of their historically complicated bilateral equations. No doubt, their difficult bilateral engagement also impacts their interactions at the multilateral level and their mutual trust deficit circumscribes their joint strategies in multilateral forums. Yet, on balance, contemporary Sino-Indian relations seem to mark a clear shift in the center of gravity from a bilateral to a multilateral matrix.

Propelled by the simultaneous phenomena of impressive economic growth and increasing technological capabilities, the two countries under review have made a paradigmatic shift from being predominantly technology-importing countries in the 1980s to technology-exporting countries at the beginning of the 21st century. The consequent outcome of this process is the changing composition of technology exports wherein the share of technology-intensive products is increasing in their overall export baskets, which is a clear indication of the two countriesâ€™ growing technological prowess. A key element in this growth is that the technology component in the overall bilateral trade between India and China is increasing both in volume and diversification. A considerable part of Chinaâ€™s exports to India constitute technology-intensive products, but primary goods dominate Indian exports to China, revealing Chinaâ€™s edge over India. This is likely to change as India strengthens its comparative advantage in software and begins to catch up with China in sectors such as manufacturing. These developments have several implications not only for their economies, but also for those in both developed and developing countries.",ESSAY,4192011,Varaprasad S.

Terms such as â€œBRICâ€ and â€œChindia,â€ and phrases such as â€œnot China or India, but China and Indiaâ€ have entered popular discourse and policy discussions. Such terms imply a synergistic relationship between China and Indiaâ€”an implication that belies the tension that has characterized Sino-Indian relations for centuries. My view is less sanguine than many othersâ€™ about the prospects of their relations. Relations between the two countries will be fraught with difficulties and will likely remain fragile. Conflict and competitiveness are deeply rooted in historical and structural causes, while forces for harmony are more contingent on political will, cultural understanding and careful policy management. There are several areas in which their relations can go wrong. At a fundamental level, the two countries are in an economically competitive, not a complementary, relationship with each other. Their economic and social endowments are similar (as compared with China/U.S. or India/U.S.). India and China offer very different lessons about economic policies and growth. This is not to suggest that the two countries are headed toward an inevitable collision, but to identify the urgency of carefully managing their relations and nurturing trust and goodwill on both sides.",ESSAY,4192011,Yasheng Huang,,,,,Produced for Digital,Asia,North Asia,South Asia,

It analyzes China and Indiaâ€™s competing interests and strategies around four broad issues: access to Africaâ€™s potentially vast markets, development cooperation, diplomatic influence and energy security. Several questions are raised based on the nature, similarities, differences and impacts of Chinese and Indian strategies. Will these create a new dynamism in South-South relations, or lead to a new form of asymmetrical relations between Africa and its Asian giant friends? What are the likely implications of closer Sino- and Indo-African ties for the continentâ€™s relations with the West, Africaâ€™s traditional trading partner, with which it has long-established relations, economic and strategic interests? In seeking explanations or answers, we caution that the differences between Chinese and Indian strategies of engagement are more of form than intent, underscoring the primacy of the competing national interests that do not completely foreclose mutually reinforcing strategies. We note that Indiaâ€™s strategies presently swing between playing â€œcatch upâ€ with Chinaâ€”which has clearly made greater inroadsâ€”and pragmatically accommodating Chinese and other interests in Africa. There are even instances, as in the case of the Sudanese oil industry, in which Chinese and Indian oil companies are cooperating as partners in an oil producing consortium, despite competing in other African countries. While the emerging scenario is one of competition that is moderated to some extent by accommodation, we conclude, based on certain conditions, that in the medium to long term, India may turn out to be more competitive than China in its engagement strategies with Africa.",ESSAY,4192011,Fantu Cheru,Cyril Obi,,,,Produced for Digital,Asia,North Asia,South Asia,East Africa

After a few years of trying to outbid each other for oil and gas exploration and production licenses, both have found it more productive to bid jointly for many such contracts. Even though neither China nor India has agreed to limits on their emissions of greenhouse gases, both are committed to reducing the carbon intensity of their development, by 40 to 45 percent from 2005 levels by 2020 for China, and 20 to 25 percent over the same time period for India. To achieve these goals, the two countries have launched major programs to install power plants using renewable energy sources and nuclear energy, and to increase the efficiency of energy use. It is unlikely that either China or India will agree to absolute reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from their present levels soon, but they may be willing to cap them at future levels that still permit their future per capita income to become comparable to that of countries in Western Europe. At the recently concluded United Nations Climate Change Conference in Cancun, China was strongly supportive of a continuation of the Kyoto Protocol for a second commitment period, but India indicated that it may be willing to explore other approaches suggested by the United States, the EU and small island nations. Though their paths to addressing climate change may begin to differ, it is highly likely that China and India will continue to share the same strategic goal of achieving parity with the West in terms of standard of living of their populations, even if it means higher emissions for another decade or two.",ESSAY,4192011,Tofiq Siddiqi,,,,,Produced for Digital,Asia,North Asia,South Asia,

It is only after the 1950 Chinese occupation of Tibet that India and China came to share the now disputed common border. In recent years, Chinaâ€™s military buildup and infrastructure development in Tibet, as well as reported plans to divert or dam rivers that rise in Tibet and flow into India, have raised Indiaâ€™s anxieties. Conversely, Chinaâ€™s insecurity about Tibet is an important driver of its approach toward India. India has been unable to assuage Chinaâ€™s fears about its possible use of the presence of the Dalai Lama in India and its large Tibetan refugee population of about 120,000 to create trouble for China in Tibet. The presence of the Dalai Lama and a large community of Tibetan refugees in India has kept the â€œTibetan questionâ€ alive. Given Indiaâ€™s open democratic system and long tradition of giving refuge to persecuted peoples, India will find it politically impossible to meet Chinaâ€™s expectations on the Tibet question without a significant quid pro quo. The breakdown of talks between the Chinese government and representatives of the Dalai Lama does not augur well for the future, and a post-Dalai Lama situation could become much more complicated. Of late, Chinaâ€™s aggressive territorial claims on India, the deepening of the China-Pakistan alliance and a shift in Chinaâ€™s position on Kashmir has led to a hardening of Indiaâ€™s position on Tibet. India is now seeking satisfaction on what it considers to be the core issues relating to Indiaâ€™s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

The U.S.-India nuclear deal and regular joint naval exercises informed Beijingâ€™s assessment that U.S.-India friendship was aimed at containing Chinaâ€™s rise. Chinaâ€™s more aggressive claims to the disputed northern borderâ€”a new challenge to Indiaâ€™s sovereignty over Kashmirâ€”and the entry of Chinese troops and construction workers in the disputed Gilgit-Baltistan region escalated the conflict. Indiaâ€™s reassessment of Chinaâ€™s intentions led the Indian military to adopt a two-front war doctrine against potential simultaneous attacks by Pakistan and China. Chinaâ€™s rivalry with India in the Indian Ocean area is also displacing New Delhiâ€™s influence in neighboring countries. As Chinaâ€™s growing strength creates uneasiness in the region, Indiaâ€™s balancing role is welcome within ASEAN. Its naval presence facilitates comprehensive cooperation with other countries having tense relations with China, most notably Japan. Indiaâ€™s efforts to outflank Chinaâ€™s encirclement were boosted after Beijing unexpectedly challenged U.S. naval supremacy in the South China Sea and the Pacific. The Obama Administration reasserted the big picture strategic vision of U.S.-India partnership first advanced by the nuclear deal.

I do this by developing a technologically determinant, intermediate bifurcation where growth shifts from being geographically to institutionally driven after enough technology has been assimilated.

As the technology level increases, income level converges toward the level of developed countries.

The essence of the Brundtland Reportâ€™s definition of sustainable development is expanding possibilities and keeping options open, not foreclosing them for future generations. The selection of technologies to advance sustainable energy development in any given country is a sovereign choice, and each country will need a mix of technologies suited to its situation and needs. As there exists no absolute yardstick for sustainable energy development and there is no technology without risk, wastes or interaction with the environment, nuclear energyâ€™s compatibility with sustainable development objectives cannot be judged in isolation but only in comparison with available alternatives. This paper will provide such comparative assessments and specifically address concerns about nuclear power, such as the longevity of radioactive wastes, operating safety, weapons proliferation as well public and political acceptance. Based on the concept of weak sustainabilityâ€™ and by applying a set of criteria for sustainable development, the paper will argue that the further development of nuclear power broadens the natural resource base for meeting growing global energy needs, increases technological and human capital, and, when safely handled, has little impact on human health and ecosystems along the full nuclear source-to-service energy chain. However, societies compare the benefits and risks of technologies from the menu of options available to them. As long as the real benefits exceed the risks of nuclear power, societies tend to accept the technology. The recent renaissance of interest in nuclear power is the result of changes in the risks and benefits of its key alternatives.",ESSAY,11172010,,,,,,Produced for Digital,Global Commons,,,

For green chemistry, and innovations for sustainable development more generally, there is a need for greater public intervention, including regulatory regimes that are strictly enforced, investment in basic research and education to build human capacity, more outreach programs in collaboration with industry to aid with technology transfer and implementation, and economic incentives for firms that may have the desire but not the financial capacity to make use of these innovations.

I argue that the modern university has fallen behind the pace of technological change and has become increasingly irrelevant to the reality of life in an interconnected and globalizing world. Academic ethnocentrism has evolved within the residential, discipline-oriented and tradition-defined higher education system. American universities have not kept up with the challenge of rapidly diagnosing and responding to increasingly complex and dynamic problems such as global warming, health and disaster mitigation. Current initiatives to improve U.S. development interventions fail to recognize the need to radically redesign higher education to implement the development initiatives of the future. A global technology- based educational movement reminiscent of the original concept of the land grant colleges in the United States is needed, which would tie an aggressive research agenda to critically examine the impacts of rapidly evolving technologies to a worldwide network of community-level agents of change that transmit positive results into immediate action. I outline a tentative plan of action based upon emerging evidence of better and more efficient training and educational models that are focused on broad-based sustainable development objectives. By removing the â€œtechno-scleroticâ€ blinders and challenging the American academe to become more applied and more international, American universities can reassert their relevance and maintain their status as preeminent institutions of social change and innovation in the realm of global higher education.",ESSAY,11172010,William E.

There is growing concern that, with the implementation of the World Trade Organizationâ€™s agreement on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs), pharmaceutical patents will restrict access to medicines globally. Profit-oriented companies are now aggressively pursuing intellectual property protections in developing countries, many of which had previously not allowed product patents on drugs. The concern is that absent generic competition, patients will not be able to access life-saving medications. Recent attention has focused on a perhaps unlikely set of actors to help ameliorate the access to medicines problem: American research universities. A decade-old student movement has argued that universities own intellectual property rights on many important drugs, and has pushed for inclusion of â€œhumanitarian licensingâ€ clauses that would compel the pharmaceutical firms that license these technologies to allow generic access in developing countries. In this paper, I discuss the emergence and evolution of this student movement, and the set of patent policy changes that got us here. I also summarize data on the feasibility of these policies: for how many drugs would changes in university policies plausibly affect access? Next, I discuss the desirability of changing university licensing practices and the tradeoffs universities face when considering humanitarian licensing approaches.

The program has developed a radically new low-cost laptop computer and aggressively promoted its plans to put the computer in the hands of hundreds of millions of children around the world, including in the most impoverished nations. Though fewer than two million of the OLPCâ€™s XO computers have been distributed as of this writing, the initiative has caught the attention of world leaders, influenced developments in the global computer industry and sparked controversy and debate about the best way to improve the lot of the worldâ€™s poor.

The paper reviews the theoretical underpinnings of OLPC, analyzes the programâ€™s development and summarizes the current state of OLPC deployments around the world. The analysis reveals that provision of individual laptops is a utopian vision for the children in the poorest countries, whose educational and social futures could be more effectively improved if the same investments were instead made on more proven and sustainable interventions. Middle- and high-income countries may have a stronger rationale for providing individual laptops to children, but will still want to eschew OLPCâ€™s technocentric vision.

Developing countries with growing emissions must somehow make emission reductions without curtailing the economic development needed to alleviate poverty. This must be done in order to permit global abatement on the scale required to avoid dangerous climate disruption. Given the limited financial and technical capabilities of developing countries, this task seems impossible without technology transfer. As policymakers continue to embrace and enhance technology transfer options, it is critical to understand the relationship between technology transfer and policy development in order to formulate more effective policies. Whether through market mechanisms, such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), or direct aid programs, such as the Green Climate Fund, we argue that technology transfer programs must support the elaboration of policies in developing countries by addressing three key issues: additionality, appropriate scale and the promotion of knowledge spillovers. We use these three principles to provide a framework for assessing the potential of both the CDM and direct financial aid to foster meaningful technology transfer, which we define as technology transfer that not only lowers the overall short-run costs of carbon reductions, but also enhances the capacity of these countries to address climate change more thoroughly in the future.",ESSAY,11172010,David M.

This issue of the Journal of International Affairs brings together work from American and South Asian scholars and policy leaders to address the issues critical to stability and development in the region. For years, American leaders prioritized regional stability over democratic development, with limited success in achieving either. With thousands of NATO troops tied down in Afghanistan and thousands more Pakistani troops engaged in a civil war on their western border, both countries remain at the center of international debates over terrorism, democratization, state-building and counterinsurgency.
 
 While Pakistan and Afghanistan continue to grapple with violent insurgencies, their civilian governments are working to consolidate the domestic support necessary for counterinsurgency and counterterrorism measures to succeed. Winning this domestic support, however, requires that governments achieve some success in improving the daily lives of their citizens. We therefore precede our considerable analysis of political and security issues with two articles that concern economics and the provision of government services in Pakistan.
 
 Ishrat Husain opens this issue with an in-depth study of Pakistanâ€™s economic development through decades of instability under both military and civilian rule. He pays particular attention to Pakistanâ€™s evolving relationship with the United States and its effect on the major economic and political developments of recent years. Husain argues that despite a longstanding consensus on the pursuit of liberal economic policies, political volatility, particularly following transitions to military rule, has wreaked havoc on social and economic development in Pakistan.
 
 Our second scholar, Andrew Wilder, posits that a wealthier Pakistani state may be of limited benefit unless the government and its international donors prioritize a politically astute public administration reform program. Wilder describes how the fundamental obstacles to reform in Pakistan are political in nature rather than gaps in understanding or technical expertise. The main challenge, he contends, is that those with the power to push for reformâ€”namely the military, politicians and civil servants themselvesâ€”have historically had a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.
 
 The way that the government responds to pressures from its citizens is the subject of C. Christine Fairâ€™s article, in which she examines Pakistani public attitudes toward domestic militants operating in Pakistan. Fair first describes the militant landscape in Pakistan before turning to polling data that illuminates Pakistani beliefs about domestic militant groups and how they are treated by the state. She concludes by discussing the implications of popular opinion on the success of Pakistanâ€™s efforts to combat militancy.
 
 Ayesha Siddiqa provides a valuable analysis of the origins and goals of various jihadist groups and describes how the changing landscape of jihadism across Pakistanâ€™s provinces is forcing a new evaluation of how Pakistanis and their government think about extremism. Siddiqa argues that this reassessment is constrained both by internal political dynamics and by Pakistanâ€™s reaction to American pressures.
 
 Marvin Weinbaum delves into militancy issues with a study identifying the factors feeding insurgency in the Pakistani tribal borderlands and neighboring regions. Weinbaum describes how the expansion of the recent crisis from the tribal areas into Swat and Buner may have instigated a major shift in Pakistanâ€™s willingness to confront threats to state authority. The study also examines the role U.S. policy may play and how progress against terrorism and the Afghan insurgency strongly hinges on Pakistanâ€™s success with both political reform and security efforts along its northwest border areas.
 
 Saeed Shafqat discusses how the United States and Pakistan are struggling to build a partnership that addresses the geostrategic and security goals of both states. Shafqat suggests that the relationship should have a solid footing based on genuinely shared interests that include the stabilization of civilian rule, the elimination of terrorism and the containment of nuclear proliferation. He argues that despite Pakistanâ€™s struggles with alternating military hegemonic and single party dominant governance, renewed American support can help Pakistan in its consolidation of genuine multi-party democracy.
 
 Bruce Riedel addresses a major potential roadblock in American-Pakistani relations in discussing the terrorist attack of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) organization in Mumbai, India in November 2008 and its implications for the entire region. He suggests that American interests in South Asia, including NATO war efforts in Afghanistan, would be set back considerably by another similar attack, especially if it led to a major Indian military response. He argues that, in addition to quietly expanding its involvement in South Asian security issues, the United States should undertake a major diplomatic effort to pressure Pakistan into shutting down LeTâ€™s operational capability.
 
 The Indo-Pakistani rivalry is further developed by Sumit Ganguly and Nicholas Howenstein. Their article traces the origins of the Indo-Pakistani rivalry in Afghanistan, assesses Indiaâ€™s current role in Afghanistan in this context and discusses the implications for American policy. They argue that American and Indian interests in Afghanistan are increasingly aligned and that long-term stability in the country will require a similar move toward concurrence of aims between India and Pakistan.
 
 Syed Hasnat focuses on Afghan-Pakistan relations, highlighting the historical tensions between the two states and outlining how their strategic policy concerns have overlapped and diverged at various times. Hasnat suggests that it is the historical differences between Afghanistan and Pakistanâ€”not their similaritiesâ€”that should guide U.S. policy in the region. He argues for both a reevaluation of Americaâ€™s AfPak strategy and for a reorientation of Pakistanâ€™s approach to dealing with its western neighbor.
 
 The difficulty of drawing analogies between the historical experiences of Pakistan and Afghanistan is highlighted by Kimberly Marten in her analysis of how outside powers have attempted to deal with tribal militias in the two states. In Afghanistanâ€™s Pashtun areas, where neo-Taliban insurgents have their ethnic base, U.S. commanders are hoping to repeat the apparent success achieved in Iraq where local militias were paid to guard their communities and support the government. Marten warns that this approach is a strategic mistake. She discusses the lessons that can be learned from a similar plan pursued by British colonial troops in what now forms the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) of Pakistan and argues that by funding and supporting new local warlords, the United States and its allies will unwittingly plant the seeds for a future round of radical Islamist backlash against warlord rule.
 
 Justin Mankin, the author of this issueâ€™s Andrew Wellington Cordier essay, addresses the impact of the drug trade on localized Afghan power structures. Mankin describes how the consolidation of state power in Kabul is impeded by the strength that involvement in the drug trade provides to local power centers, including both allies and opponents of the central government in Kabul.
 
 As Pakistan and Afghanistan struggle with the fundamental problems of achieving domestic security and consolidating democratic governance, it is important to question the role that external actors can and should play. This collection of essays provides a valuable examination of the complex relationships among the countries of this region and their ongoing political and security developments. Our contributors offer clear analysis to inform American engagement by highlighting the regionâ€™s brimming tensions and, more importantly, by outlining future prospects for sustainable peace and security.
